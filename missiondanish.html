    <p>It's a good thing to emphasize the importance of coming to Tai Chi with an open but down to Earth mind.
    It's unrealistic to think that once you learn it you'll be able to beat all other styles. 
    If it's fighting you want to learn, it wouldn't be a bad idea to expose yourself to many other combat
    styles to learn to apply the intrinsic neigong qualities efficiently in all those aspects of fighting, which it can be.
    <br>
    <br> 
    Although it's naive to think that any one "style" of combat can prevail over all others, a good neigong 
    practitioner can apply these qualities efficiently to overcome all those aspects of fighting, in some cases, even if they 
    have little actual fighting experience. This may be hard to believe for a newcomer, however this is the 
    standard we must aim for if we wish to get the most out of our training. Health and longevity with be maximized
    as well, if we apply our selves and aim for a higher standard of neigong.
    <br>
    <br>
    Having said this, it's really an understatement to suggest that someone who has neigong, but never exposed
    them self to any kind of fighting, is not a fighter, cannot fight or overcome a trained fighter with it.
    <br>
    <br>
    In my humble opinion, as a result of my own combined experience, and interaction with those who have neigong, which they
    developed through Tai Chi/Qigong training or other respective means, it is a far more worthy pursuit than Martial Arts training alone. 
    You acquire qualities that can easily be translated into movement and Martial Arts, further you cultivate health and longevity, transcend 
    them and develop things those who focus on Martial Arts alone, simply can not accomplish. And best of all, there's no need
    to take risks in combat to achieve it.
