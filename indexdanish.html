            <p> The core aspect of the Chinese Martial Arts can only be acquired through an understanding of the
            in-depth Philosophy & Methodology associated with them. When incorporated in the training, this initiates and sets in motion a process in
            the mind, body and spirit of the individual, which allows one to attain inner peace and freedom via the cultivation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neigong">neigong</a>, which is something rather powerful, having concrete and measurable applications.</p>
            <br>
            It's rather popular to claim the skills associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neigong">neigong</a>, when many of the individuals who do so, do not have a concrete understanding of it and thereby little to no measurable skill. They may either be elaborate frauds, or simply mislead.
            A common excuse those with a limited interpretation use is "the ultimate goal of Tai Chi is spiritual attainment (and not fighting)". 
            <br>
            <br>
            While it's true that "spiritual attainment" (also health and longevity) happens as a result of cultivating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neigong">neigong</a> through respective means, if those who 
            claim neigong have no enhanced awareness of the mechanics of their muscular movement, skeletal alignment, balance, kinesthesia and tactile sensitivity beyond that of a typical individual, and are unable to demonstrate that by translating it into some obvious and measurable 
            effect, like at least feats of movement or even fighting skills (if they choose to) that are not possible without it, then any mislead fool or fraudster can claim to be an "Enlightened Tai Chi Master".   
            <br>
            <br>
            There are some easy tests to determine whether an individual either has or is on the right path in cultivation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neigong">neiong</a>. These are known of by some experts in the Chinese Martial Arts community, and are becoming 
            increasingly more known of within the MMA community too know days.
            <br>
            <p>Having said this, everyone has their own respective interpretation of Tai Chi, and this is just my interpretation, you may take it or leave it. Tai Chi is very rich, and everyone has their own vision of what they'd like to achieve and promote with it. 
                    In this case it's contributing to the intrinsic understanding of the Philosophy, Methodology and Process associated with developing measurable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neigong">neigong</a></p>
